# ML-Assignment-Marketing-Data

This assignment is centered around data from a Portuguese banking institution that represents the results of multiple marketing campaigns. [In the Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/henrythemann/ML-Assignment-Marketing-Data/blob/main/notebook.ipynb), I compare the performance of multiple classifiers (k-nearest neighbors, logistic regression, decision trees, and support vector machines) and contrast my findings with those of the researchers in the original study.
